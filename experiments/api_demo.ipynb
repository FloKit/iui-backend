Be carful with the prices, I got different price check compared to the prices at the menu and when I asked, the waitress said we‚Äôve not updated our menu yet, even, they did it manually ü´£\n",
      "Review 4: Food is delicious; ordered hummus and grilled skewers. Everything is fresh made, especially the nan, which comes with the food. A must try if you are near the train station.\n",
      "Review 5: Food was decent, good portion compared to the price. The service was good, no complaints. We just didn‚Äôt like the street itself.\n",

      "The downside is tables are so close to each other.\n",
      "Review 2: The place is very popular and hence a bit crowded. The food is excellent and they have many items. The Ayran is homemade and tastes very good.\n",
      "Review 3: Best food and service I have had in Munich!\n",
      "\n",
      "The waiter was very friendly and kind, making the experience here great. The food was also delicious; I had a chicken kebab, bread and tea. I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in the city!\n",
      "Review 4: Food is super delicious, service is fast,\n",
      "Setting inside might get your clothes takes all the smell from the grill, setting outside is annoying as many kids annoy you asking for money while you are eating.\n",
      "Review 5: Lovely Arabic Iraqi restaurant, very close to Munich Center, car parking in the street is available but hard to find.\n",
      "Service is nice and very quick, the restaurant seems to be quite busy all the time, food is delicious with a good variety of grill choices and other dishes and reasonable prices.\n",

      "Last time I saw how they cooked the grill carelessly\n",
      "I don't recommend,\n",
      "Review 3: Really confused about the negative reviews because this place is incredible! The food, staff, service were all 5 stars! Portions were incredibly generous and everything was so fresh. Seriously so tasty. I never leave reviews, but felt compelled to in this instance since Sindbad‚Äôs reputation is on the line with these misleading negative reviews.\n",
      "Review 4: Nice place in heart of city near the main train station. Small place. Food was very good. Order was mixed up as we ordered 2 rice with chicken but he brought fries with chicken. On complain, he provided rice. The taste was very authentic.\n",

      "The place is usually busy and the service can be a bit chaotic but I still love it as this reminds me of Lahore Pakistan.\n",
      "Busy restaurant means it should be good.\n",

We both ordered iskandar kebap and it was more delicious than the ones we had in Istanbul. The food is halal.\n",
      "Review 3: This is the damn best t√ºrkisch place in M√ºnchen. Soup for brunch, the pre-prepared meals, and freshly made kebabs are all awesome. The baklava is one of the best as well. Quite expensive, staff could be friendlier, bread is really bad/stale (don‚Äôt eat it) but overall I‚Äôve been here many a time and will return.\n",
      "Review 4: Turkish typical restaurant very good soup‚Äôs and dessert but the byrek could be better!\n",
