      "Summary: The food at this restaurant receives mixed reviews. While the concept of mini burgers is liked by many, the taste of the burgers is not considered amazing and some of them are too saucy, which affects the overall flavor. The service is generally good, with friendly and helpful staff. The ambience is described as cozy and the restaurant is located in the historical center of the city. Price-wise, there are menu options that offer good value for money. However, some reviewers feel that the overall experience is not particularly impressive, with dry and overcooked patties, dry buns, and overpowering sauces.\n",
